    "# What’s a DSL?\n",
    "\n",
    "  > A DSL is a programming language that's targeted at a specific problem; other programming languages that you use are more general purpose. It contains the syntax and semantics that model concepts at the same level of abstraction that the problem domain offers. \n",
    "  > Debashish Ghosh; DSLs in Action\n",
    "  \n",
    "  > The basic idea of a domain specific language (DSL) is a computer language that's targeted to a particular kind of problem, rather than a general purpose language that's aimed at any kind of software problem. Domain specific languages have been talked about, and used for almost as long as computing has been done.\n",
