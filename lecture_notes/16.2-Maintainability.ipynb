Most software development tasks and software maintenance tasks are the same—except for the additional maintenance task of \"understanding the existing product.\" This task is the dominant maintenance activity, consuming roughly 30 percent of maintenance time. So, you could claim that maintenance is more difficult than development.\n",

    "    Make it easy for operations teams to keep the system running smoothly.\n",
    "  * **Simplicity**\n",
    "    Make it easy for new engineers to understand the system, by removing as much complexity as possible from the system. (Note this is not the same as simplicity of the user interface.)\n",
    "  * **Evolvability**\n",
    "    Make it easy for engineers to make changes to the system in the future, adapting it for unanticipated use cases as requirements change. Also known as extensibility, modifiability, or plasticity.\n",

    "  * Observe how different systems affect each other?\n",
    "  * Anticipate future problems and solve them before they occur (e.g., capacity planning)?\n",
    "  * Establish good practices and tools for deployment, configuration management, etc.?\n",
    "  * Perform complex maintenance tasks, such as moving an application from one platform to another?\n",
